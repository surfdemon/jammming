# Jammming project create as part of "Build web apps with React" course on CodeCademy. 

The project uses Spotify API to search for songs and then lets you add songs to a playlist within the app. 
You can then give the playlist a name and save it to Spotify. Doing so will create a new playlist within 
Spotify with the name that you gave and save all the songs to it. 

In the project I have used useState and also Redux for handling the state and data within the app. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Currently I have only focused on the basic functionality of the app and not on it visual appearance.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
